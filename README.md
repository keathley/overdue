# Overdue

My friend asked me if it was possible to scan a books barcode and look it up some how.  This is a test to see if that's possible.

## Installing

I have no idea why you would want to install this thing but just in case you do here's what to do.

    $ npm install
    $ webpack
    $ npm start

Running `npm start` will start webpack and the webpack hot reload server.

Now go scan away
